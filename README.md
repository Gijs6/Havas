# Havas

**Havas** is a webapp to both display, manage and edit news articles.

Maybe in the future I will use this for something but I just really wanted to build a great backend.

Havas is named after **Charles-Louis Havas**, the founder of the first news agency.

## Run yourself

If you want to run the site yourself, just clone this repo, install all the required packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `py main.py` (`flask --app main run` also works, but that could be with some diffrent settings). You can then visit the site at `localhost:2000` (or another link, the correct link will be printed in the terminal).
