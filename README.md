# Havas

**Havas** is a webapp to both display, manage and edit news articles.

Maybe in the future I will use this for something but I just really wanted to build a great backend.

Havas is named after **Charles-Louis Havas**, the founder of the first news agency.

## To do

- [x] Add manager and just all things with that
- [ ] Add auth for the manager
- [x] Add edited datetimes (for the articles)
- [x] Add editor/uploader for cover images
- [ ] Add 404 and 500 and just better error handling (file not found and such)
- [ ] Add media page in the manager
- [ ] Add inline pictures
- [ ] Add inline video's
